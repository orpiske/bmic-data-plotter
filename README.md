BMIC Data Plotter: A Java library to plot BMIC report Files
============


Introduction

This library reads compressed CSV files generated by the BMIC daemon of the [Messaging Performance Test Tool](https://github.com/orpiske/msg-perf-tool/) and plot them. It makes it
easier to integrate processing of those files into custom automation tools without relying on Excel, GNUPlot or
GoogleCharts.
It can be used as a command-line tool or it can be integrated in other projects as a library.
